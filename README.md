# Slices

This Go Package implements some of the methods to handle arrays in functional languages
Including:

-   map
-   filter
-   reduce
-   some
-   every
-   flat

Were applicable generics and concurrency is used.

Main purpose of this package is to practice generics and concurrency.
Also I provide a way to impose DRY in my other projects.

## Plans

Refactoring of names is planned in the next few days. Before actually publishing the project for the public I plan to add testing
and a more extensive documentation.
